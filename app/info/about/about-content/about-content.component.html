of Tamil Nadu’s Tribal Languages and Cultures</font></b></font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">Multilingualism
is the lifeblood of every multicultural society. Tamil Nadu, shaped
by its inclusive linguistic ethos, recognises the richness of its
knowledge systems and cultural practices—many sustained through the
intergenerational transmission of tribal languages. Each of these
languages is a distinct repository of knowledge, encoding ecological
wisdom, lived experience, and cultural expression. Recognising this,
the Government of Tamil Nadu has taken up the mantle of
responsibility. Language is not merely a tool of communication; it is
a chronicle of memories and meaning.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">According
to UNESCO’s 2010 <i>Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger</i>,
over 40% of the world’s 7,000 indigenous and tribal languages are
endangered. India is home to many such languages, with several found
within Tamil Nadu. In response to this alarming trend, the Government
of Tamil Nadu has launched the <b>Tholkudi Scheme</b>, aimed at
documenting the linguistic resources of the state’s tribal
communities. As part of this initiative, the <b>Tholkudi Digital
Repository</b> has been established as a committed effort to preserve
the digital records of the linguistic and cultural heritage of Tamil
Nadu’s indigenous communities and to facilitate their transmission
to future generations.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">In
response to global concerns,Tamil Nadu launched the Tholkudi Scheme
to digitally preserve the linguistic heritage of its tribal
communities. In 2024, the Hon’ble Finance Minister Thangam
Thennarasu announced a landmark initiative inspired by the state’s
ancient civilisational ethos. The journey began with a national
seminar in Chennai (27–28 September 2024), bringing together
scholars, activists, and tribal representatives. This led to the
selection of six documentation projects focusing on five tribal
languages: Toda, Irular, Narikuravar, Kani, and Kurumba.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">The
Tholkudi Digital Repository is part of a pioneering initiative by the
Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, dedicated to
preserving, revitalising, and celebrating the languages and cultural
heritage of the state’s tribal communities. Its primary mission is
the long-term preservation of digital records of these languages,
ensuring they remain accessible for future generations.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">The
repository supports documentation teams in creating high-quality
digital records in open, preservation-friendly formats. It serves as
a platform for the ethical archiving, community-led curation, and
dissemination of linguistic and cultural resources, enabling both
academic research and community-led revitalisation efforts.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">The
Tholkudi Digital Repository serves five core objectives to enable
sustainable and ethical linguistic documentation:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Support Linguistic Documentation – Train teams and archive data
	using 	standardised, open formats.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Safeguard Cultural Knowledge – Digitally preserve traditional
	practices and oral knowledge.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Enable Digital Access – Build an open, multilingual archive driven
	by community participation.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Align with Global Standards – Contribute to the International
	Decade of Indigenous Languages and foster global academic
	partnerships.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.17in">
	Empower Communities – Centre tribal voices in knowledge creation
	and intergenerational transmission.</p></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">The
Los Pinos Declaration [Chapoltepek] (2020), the outcome document of
the <b>International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL2019),
</b>provides a roadmap for action during the Decade, emphasising the
principle “Nothing for us without us.” It calls for Indigenous
communities to be central to decision-making, consultation, and
planning. It also highlights key priorities such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Promoting Indigenous languages in education, health, and public
	life.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Using digital
	technologies and media for language empowerment.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Safeguarding
	cultural and linguistic heritage as living traditions.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ensuring
	inclusive, 	long-term action through global partnerships.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">Building
on national initiatives like the Central Institute of Indian
Languages’ Scheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered
Languages (SPPEL) and the programs introduced under the 12th
Five-Year Plan, Tamil Nadu’s Tholkudi Scheme marks a significant
step forward. It embeds language preservation within the framework of
tribal welfare policy, treating linguistic dignity not as an isolated
concern but as integral to cultural identity and community
empowerment. By institutionalising this approach, the state reaffirms
that safeguarding Indigenous languages is fundamental to securing
equitable development and cultural justice for its tribal
communities.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">The
Tholkudi Digital Repository emerged from the national seminar held in
Chennai in September 2024, uniting tribal elders, civil society
actors, and academic experts. The projects selected exemplify a
collaborative approach, placing Indigenous communities at the centre
of documentation. The repository puts into practice the CARE
Principles—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics—ensuring that tribal communities retain
agency over how their languages and traditions are archived,
accessed, and reused<i>.</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">Tholkudi
is more than a repository; it is a living cultural commons.<i> </i>It
documents not just words, but worldviews: the Kwasrm couplets of the
Toda that encode clan and landscape histories, Irula medicinal
practices grounded in ecological knowledge, Kurumba visual art as a
mode of storytelling, and Kanikaran’s Satru Pattu songs that
reflect ritual continuity. Tholkudi is a site for intergenerational
learning, digital storytelling, and curriculum development; anchored
in community voices and guided by global Indigenous rights
frameworks.</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.17in">By
embodying the principles of the Los Pinos Declaration, the Tholkudi
scheme, along with its digital repository, stands as a model for
localising international commitments. It affirms Tamil Nadu’s
leadership in preserving cultural and linguistic diversity and
envisions a future where every language, however small, is treated as
a world in itself.</p>
